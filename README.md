# PASSWORD GENERATOR
Very simple python password genarator using a dictionary file of 240.000+ common/and uncommon Icelandic words.

Usage:
```
python passwords.py n
```
Where n is a number between 1 and 10

*Note that the python file and the dict file have to be in the same directory, any UTC-8 dict file will do,
dict file should though be a list of words with one word in each line. Any other format will produce
an unpredictable outcome.*
